# Programs

# We draw the Figure 3 in our paper called "Certification of Almost Global Phase Synchronization of All-To-All Coupled Phase Oscillators" bu using the Matlab program "Figure3Program.m".

# We construct the program "FourOscillatorsThreeDimensional.nb" to indicate how to tranform the phase differences (i.e. system of \varphi_i's) given in (2.3) to the system (2.5) for 3 dimension by using  stereographic state transformation (2.4) in our paper. The program can also be modified for higher dimensions.

# We create the program "FourierTransformer.nb" to show how to convert the Fourier coefficients of the coupling function into the parameters of the function given only by sinus.
